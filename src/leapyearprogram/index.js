//Write a function leapYear(year) that returns true if the year is a leap year, false otherwise. The rules for leap years are:
//
//Only apply to years since 1582, throw an error for anything else
//if a year is divisible by 4 then it is a leap year
//except years divisible by 100, those are not leap years
//except years divisible by 400, those are leap years
//Write tests for the various requirements.
